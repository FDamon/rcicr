\title{Computes Informational Value}
\usage{
computeInfoVal2IFC(ci, rdata)
}
\arguments{
\item{ci}{A classification image object (list-type) as returned by generateCI}

\item{rdata}{String pointing to .RData file that was created when stimuli were generated. This file contains the contrast parameters of all generated stimuli and possibly its corresponding reference distribution generated with generateReferenceDistribution().}
}
\value{
Informational value (z-score)
}
\description{
Computes Informational Value for a single CI in a 2IFC task.
}
\details{
The Informational Value metric can be considered as a z-score that quantifies the signal
present in a classification image. The higher the Informational Value, the more signal. It is
possible to use a cut-off such as z = 1.96 to select classification images with significant
signal under alpha = 0.05.

Informational Value is computed by simulating random responding under identical task parameters to
an empirical dataset. The metric quantifies how unlikely it is to observe these data under the
null-hypothesis that there is no signal (i.e., that there is only random responding).

For more information see Brinkman, Goffin, Aarts, van Haren, & Dotsch (in prep).
