\title{Generates a Z-map}
\usage{
generateZmap(zmap, bgimage, name, sigma, threshold, targetpath = "zmaps",
  size = 512, decoration = F, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{zmap}{A matrix containing z-scores that map onto a given base image. zmap and baseimage must have the same dimensions.}

\item{bgimage}{A matrix containing the grayscale image to use as a background. This should be either the base image or the final CI.}

\item{name}{The name of this Z-map (usually the name of the base image).}

\item{sigma}{The sigma of the smoothing that was applied to the CI to create the Z-map.}

\item{threshold}{The threshold Z-score that was applied to the Z-map.}

\item{targetpath}{String specifying path to save the Z-map PNG to.}

\item{size}{Integer specifying the width and height of the PNG image (default: 512).}

\item{decoration}{Optional boolean specifying whether the Z-map should be plotted with margins, text (sigma, threshold) and a scale (default: TRUE).}

\item{...}{Additional arguments to be passed to raster::plot. Only applied when decoration is TRUE.}
}
\value{
Nothing. It writes a Z-map image.
}
\description{
Generates a Z-map given a matrix of z-scores that maps onto a specified base image.
}
\details{
This function takes in a matrix of z-scores (as returned by generateCI) and an Rdata file containing a base image. It returns a Z-map image in PNG format.
