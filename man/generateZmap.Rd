\title{Generates a Z-map}
\usage{
generateZmap(cilist, img_size = 512, sigma = 10, threshold = 3,
  directional = F, saveasjpeg = T, targetpath = "./zmaps")

generateZmap(cilist, img_size = 512, sigma = 10, threshold = 3,
  directional = F, saveasjpeg = T, targetpath = "./zmaps")
}
\arguments{
\item{cilist}{A list object (as returned by generateCI) containing at least the "ci" and "combined" element.}

\item{img_size}{Integer specifying size of the stimuli used in number of pixels.}

\item{sigma}{Optional number specifying the level of smoothing applied in calculating the z-map (default: 10).}

\item{threshold}{Optional number specifying the threshold absolute z-score value used in calculating the z-map (default: 3).}

\item{directional}{Optional boolean specifying whether different colors should be used for negative and positive z-scores (default: F).}

\item{saveasjpeg}{Optional boolean specifying whether to write the Z-map to a JPEG image (default: TRUE).}

\item{targetpath}{String specifying path to save the Z-map PNG to.}

\item{zmap}{A matrix containing z-scores that map onto a given base image. zmap and baseimage must have the same dimensions.}

\item{baseimage}{String specifying which base image was used. Not the file name, but the key used in the list of base images at time of generating the stimuli.}

\item{rdata}{String pointing to .RData file that was created when stimuli were generated. This file contains the contrast parameters of all generated stimuli.}

\item{targetpath}{Optional string specifying path to save JPEGs to (default: ./zmaps).}
}
\value{
Nothing. It writes a Z-map image.

Array representing an RGB image.
}
\description{
Generates a Z-map given a matrix of z-scores that maps onto a specified base image.

Generates Z-map for a given classification image.
}
\details{
This function takes in a matrix of z-scores (as returned by generateCI) and an Rdata file containing a base image. It returns a Z-map image in PNG format.

This function saves the Z-map (superimposed on the scaled classification image) to a folder.
