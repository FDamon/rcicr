# rcicr

This package contains functions needed for conducting reverse correlation image classification experiments in psychology (generating stimuli and classification images). 

For more information, see http://www.rondotsch.nl/rcicr.

We would very much welcome any contributions, thoughts and criticisms you might have! Please submit an issue at https://github.com/rdotsch/rcicr/issues.

## Using the dev version (AT YOUR OWN RISK!) ##
To use the development version, do as follows:

1. If you do not have the devtools R package installed yet, install it with this command: ```install.packages('devtools')```
2. Load the devtools package: ```library(devtools)```
3. Install the package: ```install_github('rdotsch/rcicr', ref = 'development')```

## Caution!! ##
Please do keep in mind that although we try not to break things on the development branch, it *is* the development branch and hence there may be problems, errors and issues we haven't discovered yet. If you do run into these, we would of course appreciate if you'd let us know (just file an issue).

Most importantly: **We do not recommend that you use the development version for analysis meant for publication**. Please wait until we make a new version available on CRAN for that.
